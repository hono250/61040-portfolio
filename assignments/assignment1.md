# Assignment 1 - Problem Fraiming 

## Domains
1.	Social Media Automation – AI driven content creation and posting.
2.	Fitness Tracking – Exercise monitoring and progress analysis.
3.	Educational Technology – Learning tools and skill development. 
4.	Food & Nutrition – Meal planning and dietary tracking.
5.	Financial Management – Budgeting and expense tracking.
6.	Creative Expression – Digital art, music, or writing tools.
7.	Time Management – Time-blocking and schedule planning for students. 
8.	Art Portfolio Development – Sketch-to-portfolio progress tracker for art.
9.	Church Community Management – Church media & volunteer coordination.
10.	Study aid Technology – Notes-to-quiz study helper.

**Three domains I’m most interested in:**

- **Social Media Automation**: I’m interested in this domain because I see the burden content creation sometimes places on individuals and small business without the guarantee of success. I recognized the commercial potential of unrestricted content creation with the use of AI and I’m interested in building something around automated TikTok content creation.

- **Fitness Tracking**: This domain resonates with me as an active gym user who used to rely on simple note taking for tracking workouts but then switched to a workout tracking app that proved to be very effective with tracking workouts as well ass progress. I also see a limitation of lack of access to personalized insights which is an opportunity for innovation in user experience and data analysis. 

- **Church Community Management**: This domain interests me because religious communities face specific organizational challenges that mainstream software does not address with a wide range of options. Churches need to coordinate volunteers, manage media content, communicate with members, and organize events and having observed how churches struggle juggling multiple generic tools , I see an opportunity to create a solution that understands the specific needs of these communities. 


## Problems

**Social Media Automation:**

1.	Content creation burnout – consistent, engaging content creation.
2.	Audience engagement – Posting at optimal times for maximum reach. 
3.	Multi-Platform Management – Managing content across different social platforms.
   
**Fitness Tracking:**

1.	Progress plateau detection – Difficulty identifying when to add weight, reps or deload, leading to stalling. 
2.	High-friction logging – typing sets/weights mid workout is annoying, so people skip logs and loose data. 
3.	Exercise form verification – No way to ensure proper technique during workouts.
   
**Church Community Management:**

1.	Volunteer coordination chaos – scheduling and organizing volunteer activities
2.	Media content organization – Managing sermons, announcements, and digital content
3.	Member communication gaps – Keeping the variety of groups informed and connected is a challenge

### Selected Problems

1.	**Content creation burnout (Social Media Automation)** – This problem effects millions of content creators, businesses, and other people who want to join the field. It also has a clear and measurable outcome if addressed (time saved per video, consistency of posting). 

*Excluded from this domain:*

- Audience engagement: Interesting but it seems to be more of a feature than a core problem. 
- Multi-Platform Management: I presume this would be very challenging since it would require extensive API integrations. 

2.	**High-friction logging (Fitness Tracking)** – If logging is effortless and the app suggests next steps based on data; it would encourage consistent use hence results. In some fitness apps, the data collected is often unused instead of being transformed into insights that can guide next steps. 

*Excluded from this domain:*

- Exercise form verification: would require computer vision and motion analysis and would require a lot of data (for each exercise) to implement.
- Progress plateau detection: Would be addressed as a feature of selected problem via auto progress suggestion.

3.	**Volunteer coordination chaos (Church Community Management)** – Churches rely heavily on volunteers but often with no fast and clear coordination methods. I think a solution that streamlines volunteer management would be a new and useful tool for this specific market with less competition than general productivity tools.

*Excluded from this domain:*

- Media content organization: this is primarily a content management problem that existing tools handle well.
- Member communication gaps: Too similar to existing communication tools. 


## Stakeholder Analysis
1.	Content creation burnout (Social Media Automation):
- Content creator: person trying to save time while maintaining their social media presence. 
- Platform algorithm: the automated systems that determine content visibility. 
- Audience: people consuming the generated content benefit from more content options but might see this as a negative thing if people dislike AI generated content.
  
*Impact*: Better tempo for creators; Platform algorithm benefits fromengeging, consistent content that keeps users on platform for longer; more consistent viewing for followers.

2.	High-friction logging (Fitness Tracking):
- Gym users – primary users logging workouts and tracking progress 
- Personal trainers – professionals who might want to use structured data to guide their clients.
- Platform integrators (Health/Watch) – seekers of more accurate activity data.
  
*Impact*: Higher adherence, smarter progression, fewer plateaus all benefitting the primary user.

3.	Volunteer coordination chaos (Church Community Management):
- Volunteer coordinator – person managing church volunteer programs.
- Church volunteer - person donating time to church activities.
- Event organizer - person planning specific events needing volunteers.
  
*Impact*: Less stress, fewer mistakes, more reliable flow.
